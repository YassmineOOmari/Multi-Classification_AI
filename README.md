# Multi-Classification_AI
The is a multi-class classification problem. The goal is to classify observations into one of three classes based on the provided dataset.


### Exercise:

Using the datasets methods in sklearn (make_classification), create a
data set with 500,000 observations and 3 classes. Add some noise too.

1. Implement a neural network model with 4 hidden layers using Keras
2. Varying the number of neurons and activation functions
3. Plot the training and testing error, training and testing accuracy
4. Plot the confusion matrix and write a summary of your findings.

## Findings :

Old Findings :: 

- The model achieved a high level of accuracy during both the training and testing phases, with a training accuracy of 96.35% and a testing accuracy of 96.10%.
- The testing loss and training loss are close in range, indicating that the modelis a perfect fit.
- The confusion matrix shows that the model had similar performance for all three classes, with only a small number of misclassifications.

=====

New fidings using higher noise value ::

- Training accuracy: 96.56%
- Testing accuracy: 96.50%

The new testing accuracies indicate that the model is good and is not overfitting.
